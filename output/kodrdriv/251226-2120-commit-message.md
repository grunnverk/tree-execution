chore(output/kodrdriv): update autogenerated kodrdriv outputs

- Remove stale autogenerated commit-message draft:
  - output/kodrdriv/251226-2023-commit-message.md
- Add new agentic reflection log (autogenerated):
  - output/kodrdriv/agentic-reflection-commit-2025-12-27T04-23-45-883Z.md

These files are autogenerated by kodrdriv (commit-message drafts / reflection logs). They are kept in the repo here for reference, but are not source artifacts. Consider moving such outputs to a separate branch/archive or adding output/kodrdriv to .gitignore to avoid repository noise and accidental commits.
